# Spotify-Style User Recommendation System

This is my simple, self-made music recommendation project.  
I wanted to understand how Spotify-like systems work, so I picked up a dataset from kaggle and created few columns on my own as per requirement, cleaned everything myself, uploaded it to MySQL, and started building insights and most importantly understanding how data works and how to make conclusions based on the dataset.

The goal wasn’t to make a huge complex ML model.  
The goal was to understand the full pipeline:  
data → cleaning → SQL → BI → ML → recommendations.

## Why I Made This
I’m learning data science and I wanted one project that connects everything:
- SQL  
- Python  
- Data cleaning  
- Analytics  
- Power BI  
- Basic ML  
  
Everything done manually so I truly understand what’s happening.

---

## What This Project Contains
- A fully cleaned listening history dataset
- CSV file (kaggle dataset, but modified and added new columns as per requirements)
- A MySQL table with 1.4L+ rows  
- A data dictionary (explains every column)  
- SQL scripts  
- (Soon) Power BI dashboards for user behaviour  
- (Soon) Python notebook for simple recommendations  

I’ll keep updating this as I learn more.

## Tech Used
- Python (for data cleaning + ML later)
- MySQL (main storage)
- Power BI (visuals)
- Github
- Excel (for data cleaming, and to generate missing key columns)

---

## Future Plans
- Build a tiny recommendation engine  
- Add user and song clustering  
- Add a “Spotify Wrapped” style dashboard  
- Deploy a small demo  

---

## My Learning Goal
I am from a non-tech background but I want to build a strong data + ML foundation.  
This project is my way of learning the full workflow instead of moving onto ML directly.
